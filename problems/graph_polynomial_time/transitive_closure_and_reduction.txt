Input description: A directed graph G = (V, E).
Problem description: For transitive closure, construct a graph G ′ = (V, E ′ ) with
edge (i, j) ∈ E ′ iff there is a directed path from i to j in G. For transitive reduction,
construct a small graph G ′ = (V, E ′ ) with a directed path from i to j in G ′ iff there
is a directed path from i to j in G.
